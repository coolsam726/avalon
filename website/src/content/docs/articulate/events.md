## Query scopes

### Local scopes

Local scopes allow you to define common sets of query constraints for reuse. Name the method `scope_<name>`. The **query is the first argument**:

```python
# app/models/post.py
class Post(Model):
    def scope_published(query):
        return query.where("published", True)

await Post.query().published().get()
```

Also accepted: `scope_published(cls, query)` as a classmethod, or `(self, query)` style. Returning a builder is optional — mutating `query` in place is fine.

### Global scopes

```python
# app/models/user.py
User.add_global_scope("active", lambda query: query.where("active", True))
await User.without_global_scope("active").get()
await User.without_global_scopes().get()
```

## Soft deleting

In addition to actually removing records from your database, Articulate can "soft delete" models. Soft deletes do not remove the row; they set a `deleted_at` timestamp.

```python
# app/models/post.py
from avalon.orm import Model, SoftDeletes

class Post(SoftDeletes, Model):   # mixin before Model
    fillable = ("title",)

await post.delete()               # sets deleted_at
await Post.query().get()          # excludes trashed
await Post.with_trashed().get()
await Post.only_trashed().get()
post.trashed()
await post.restore()
await post.force_delete()         # hard DELETE
```

Add `table.soft_deletes()` on your migration blueprint.

## Events

Articulate models dispatch several events, allowing you to hook into the following moments: `retrieved`, `creating`, `created`, `updating`, `updated`, `saving`, `saved`, `deleting`, `deleted`, `restoring`, `restored`, and `replicating`.

```python
# app/models/post.py
Post.listen("creating", lambda model: ...)

class PostObserver:
    def created(self, model):
        ...

Post.observe(PostObserver)
```

A listener that returns `False` aborts that lifecycle step (`save` / `delete` / `restore`). Async listeners are awaited on the async path. `retrieved` and `replicating` fire in a sync context — do not pass async callbacks there.
