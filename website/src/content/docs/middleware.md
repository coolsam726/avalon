title: Middleware
description: Register and configure HTTP middleware in your Avalon application.
---

Middleware provide a convenient mechanism for inspecting and filtering HTTP requests entering your application. For example, Avalon includes middleware for setting the request locale. You may also write your own.

Like Laravel 11, Avalon registers middleware in **`bootstrap/app.py`**. Keep `config/http.py` for group shells and defaults; put your application's middleware wiring in the bootstrap configurator.

## Registering middleware

```python
from pathlib import Path

from avalon.framework import Application, Middleware
from avalon.http import HEADER_X_FORWARDED_ALL
from avalon.translation import SetLocaleMiddleware

BASE_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent


def configure_middleware(middleware: Middleware) -> None:
    middleware.trust_proxies(at="*", headers=HEADER_X_FORWARDED_ALL)
    middleware.trust_hosts(at=["example.com", "*.example.com"])
    middleware.alias({"locale": SetLocaleMiddleware})
    middleware.web(append=["locale"])
    middleware.api(append=["locale"])


application = (
    Application.configure(BASE_PATH)
    .with_middleware(configure_middleware)
    .create()
)
asgi = application.asgi
```

Your ASGI entry point is `asgi` — deploy that with Uvicorn or any ASGI server. Application code should not import FastAPI directly.

## Configurator API

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `alias({…})` | Bind short names for use on routes and groups |
| `web(append=…, prepend=…, replace=…)` | Middleware for the `web` group |
| `api(append=…, prepend=…, replace=…)` | Middleware for the `api` group |
| `group(name, …)` | Define any named group |
| `append` / `prepend` / `use` | Global stack (every request) |
| `trust_proxies(at=…, headers=…)` | Trust `X-Forwarded-*` from the given peers |
| `trust_hosts(at=…)` | Allowlist `Host` headers (others receive `400`) |

`trust_proxies` wraps the ASGI application so client IP, scheme, host, port, and `root_path` reflect forwarded headers. `trust_hosts` prepends global middleware that rejects disallowed hosts.

Header bitmasks are available from `avalon.http` (`HEADER_X_FORWARDED_FOR`, `HEADER_X_FORWARDED_HOST`, `HEADER_X_FORWARDED_PORT`, `HEADER_X_FORWARDED_PROTO`, `HEADER_X_FORWARDED_PREFIX`, `HEADER_X_FORWARDED_ALL`, `HEADER_X_FORWARDED_AWS_ELB`).

:::tip
Callbacks run after configuration is loaded and merge into `http.*`. In tests you can still call `Application(base).bootstrap()` without the fluent builder.

## Writing middleware

A middleware class exposes an async `handle` method that receives the request and a `next` callable:

```python
class DemoTagMiddleware:
    async def handle(self, request, next):
        response = await next(request)
        # inspect or mutate response…
        return response
```

Generate a stub with:

```bash
python grail make:middleware DemoTagMiddleware
```

Then alias it in `bootstrap/app.py` and attach it to a group or route.
